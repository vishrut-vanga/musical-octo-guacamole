## ðŸ›  Features
- **Data Extraction and Processing**:
  - Extracted GDP and life expectancy data from the dataset.
  - Applied mathematical operations to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Created scatter plots to explore the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
  - Generated subplots to display trends for unique countries.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified a positive correlation: countries with higher GDP generally exhibit higher life expectancy.
  - Concluded that lower GDP often corresponds to lower life expectancy at birth.
